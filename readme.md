# ![logo maybe](./graphics/mainmenu/LTTW)
nothing burger for the moment :P

yes the logo is just `free serif` idc

## how to run?
### from pk3
1. [install gzdoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads)
2. get the pk3 from the releases
3. get doom2.wad from somewhere [(the internet archive)](https://archive.org/details/DOOM2IWADFILE) and put it in the gzdoom directory
4. drag and drop the pk3 file to the gzdoom exe, or open the pk3 archive with gzdoom

## make sure to
inside gzdoom's doom 2 options:
- set `display options > prefered rendering api` to `OpenGL` or `OpenGl ES`
- set `display options > render mode` to `hardware accelerated`
- set `gameplay options > allow freelook` to `on`

TODO: I'll try to package everything in a single executable after i finish but for now you should do that (not that difficult) :P
